# VaPoPredictor

The aim of this project is to predict vapor pressures for many chemical species as a function of temperature and molecular descriptors. 
The data set is taken from our [MLCE book](https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/04_DNN_VLE.html) and the [RDKit toolkit](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.html). 
The temperatures and pressures are given in K and kPa, respectively.
